and two differnet news outlets groups , conservative and liberal , that feed into those serpeate ideologies , and provide what seems like facts to back either one up , but only for tht particular group , further polarizing the US
oliver isnt , my point is tht there are two differnt world views in the US , rural and urban
colbert or oreilly
they do , yes , and same , but the problem is is that all of them are cherry picking , and pople treat them as news sources , what ever it is they watch
they now have two different news structures that validate what it is that they want to believe in , one for liberals and one for conservatives
calling refugees rapists is propaganda , they do , but thts the problem , not only do they believe what they want to
yh i dont mean they never lie , but u get ma point
oh fox news
who
but not the whole truth
partly yes , its not tht its not based on fact , its based on cherry picked fact tht compliments our confirmation bias , for example fox news , they dont lie , they tell facts
yup
with repsect to time sure , but at any instantaneoud moment reality can exist differently from a concocted reality manifested out of a different set of facts
how are we sure tht based ont he facts that we have studied tht we have understood true reality and not one we concocted , its called the anstropomorphoc problem , or somethingl ike tht
eh my point is tht questioning reality has some validity to it , its part of the point of science
yh
idk I think the fact tht so many assign themselves to nearly an entirely different world view is representative of the fact that having a world view and a factual well of info to support it is not such a simple and deterministic system , that there is a propagation of lies and error that can easily deviate the rational from the correct pov
right , but peer review really only exists in science , journalism doesnt have tht strucuture , science can aslo be self tested if need be , and is an intentionally slow process
thts my point , arent uat all afriad tht ur view of the world is the one that is wrong , should u not ever prepare for tht eventuality
exactly
in the end were notw approaching the descarte problem onf understanding wut is the real world lmao
u were like `` world needs better crit thinking skills '' , delusion and gas lighting are independent of crit thinking skills , one can e a genius , and delusional , et perfectly rational
maybe the asnwer is robots
lmao i love how u think these answers are simple tho , like nah man , this has beena problem since the dawn of civilizations , rome , byzantium , china , the problem isnt new at all , and the asnwer is really hard , bc its how were hard wired
how do u know ur not the delusional one
yh , progress ?
no idea , christianity is , or was , a dog became a presit b4 a woman , gg
not sure if this is stuff tht can be solved really anyways , understanding why humans create and then obsess over religions is mysterious , were not perfectly rational beings , thinking we are is a huge part of the problem
lol when it comes to religion it is
yh but thts polarization in genreal now , general , once theres one thing someone doesnt like they dismiss any of the valid points an article or person may have made
yh only the british loved their pale skin , italians and germans not so much , tht olive or gold tan is dope
not spanish either
i get it but just one ti bit , it was mostly the british , i aint british
you cant be racist agasint whites ?
its fine
yh but why , like in a true pc world , wouldnt it be none , but in a liberal bias pc world
freshman year
like FUCK OFF ik im white
and then make fun of my suit wearing bc its privilidged and all
bc they all tell me not to be racist with my microagressions
i hate sjw
1 , maybe 2
sjw
being aware of microagressions is one thing , but correcting each one is taxing
its not their fault if they are somewhat racist in a microagression , but maybe fix society and those microagressions will go away
its not 100 % social jusitce politcs poltics politics
OMG , thts so much energy into politics , like ppl live their lives too
yh but to correct and yell at them each time is inefficient and pointless
so microaggressions are the new broken window policy of racial tensions , oh yay , there are fundamental underlying phenomena and problems to every microagression that is a amcroagression that actually deserves the attention
i disagree with the microaggression warfare bc it makes a mountain out of every molehill , remember what happened ot ht eboy who cried wolf
from experience tho when somone has to defend a comment with , im just kidding , it likely was racist
like I said ive heard shit
no i mean the racism is obvious , i grew up in a white suburb , its obvious
yh tht I can agree on , but like , its abvious
in the end im not afraid of actual jokes , ive heard ppl say disgusting racist things and id rather focus on slapping the shit outta those asshats
i live in bayside buddy , close to long isalnd , LI is mad conservatie , very waspy
like to remind ourselves what happened , wut
also how conservatives always talk about 9/11 every now and then , for like a good hour everyons shares the same sad story ive heard 200 times
thts strange
is why ppl thought obama was a kenyan muslim , I was like
interesting child , the only thing I was realy confused with years ago , like when I was 13
is this 15 yr old rina or 20 yr old rina
the did when I was younger , until like 2nd yr hs
yh mine dont either anymore
yh
like isnt tht the appeal of the gop and dems too
isnt any political party a special club tho
yh same with communism and anarchism
dude a lot of em do
my cousing legit complained to my borther about how often his mom and dad talk about trump , and yh i think its zombek , , from lag
4chan is disgusting , some ppl from lag post from it all the time im like , go away , ive been there too , but my point with tht last comment is that ur missing a big part of the puzzle if u consider these 13 yr olds on youtube seperate from their parents , who are saying the same stuff
who barrade them with conservative topics
edgelords ? , u mean 13 yr old conservatives , who ahve 40 yr old fox news conservative parents
yh , theyre little shits who need to be taught , not yelled at
a p good way of making someone look bad , lol idk I think u shouldnt mind it bc u know ur not one , not bc u are tho , like u know they got nothing left in their argument other than `` well u know what ur just another sjw '' , like thts cool , u cant create coherent sentences but imma sjw
corny but true , but also ppl use sjw just to completely invalidate someones claims , its just a debate tactic
ahh I gothcu , yh sjw is also somewhat a conservative term for dem , like snowflake , ive been called a snowflake often
NO , anti sjw isnt anti social justice , its anti- being a condescneding dick , who has no real care about the actual issues theyre talkign about
lmao dont become an sjw rina
its about the way they make arguments , read the urban dictionary def on sjw , the first one is spot in , on
again sjw isnt about pointing out privledge or any one thing
no lmao
i have one on my news feed
yh those are sjw
... , k , and trump is president , so th epink hats arent tht importnat now are they
like if a joke isnt funny im not like , OMG DONT SAY THT , im just like bruh , ur an asshole
thts how i phrase it
i mean why d we have to call it pc social justice , ur not fucing spiderman , ur just not being an asshole
and make the dems lok bad , ur not one of em , as least from wut ive seen , ur aslo quite neutral in comparison to an sjw , sjw do not listen to th eother side , bc they know theyre aldready right
i wanted to laugh , no , thts why I wouldnt describe u as a sjw , sjw yell at radmon ppl on the street and seem to think they know exactly everything , they create scenes , drama
like stfu i dont have an agenda agasint someone
but are they , bc they go at peoples necks as if they are holier than thou
lol they feel it sure
hmm , which came first , the environment of anti pc , or extremists being comfortable
lol aii
we just sit there bc every word annoys someone
y , lmao , is the limit of pc when we cant speak anymore
tht rednecks can be made fun of for being stupid and have down syndome or so on , but then a gay joke cant be made , i mean i dont care I laugh when something is funny
is tht pc humor , the problem with the idea of pc humor is tht it may come with its own political bias , tht self contradicts the word pc , so its confuses ppl
like for instanec all late night talk shows make fun of rednecks and trump voters
sure comedy might enable em , but its enables everyone , liberals and conservatives alike , hence late night talk shows
no but the actual racists are scary , are they enabling them
im not terrified of 13 yr olds thinking they the shit , theyre 13 , im worried about the 40 yr olds who do
13 yr olds are assholes
i was like tf is wrong with u
tht was the first ful video of his i watched
yo tht video pissed me off
some of them seem real racist
in context its ok , but u can tell when its really racist , ina text comment its difficult tho
right
so insane its boderline cartoonish
like tht shit was insane
ok lol , i dont find rape jokes funny , at all , nazi jokes are funny bc of the level of ridiculousness of the nazis themsleves
yh denouncing a kill al jews sign in gneral sint , but yh its a joke , 9/11 jokes ?
lmao so is h3h3 , and everyone else , sjw ness is very annoying
oh i think ik what channel ur talking about lol , forgot their name rn
rape jokes arent funny , theyre weird , af , race jokes are apparently very funny when its at white people tho so tht shit confuses me , like if race jokes arent funny then dont make jokes about white ppl , cant , kay then stfu , and yh everyone hates hitler , i love hitler killing jokes
So is killing Hitler humor PC humor ?
This article is hilarious , And cringe worthy , At the same tine
It 's not tht serious , Bro is a common word idk , don't have to be a male to be a bro , Jesus man , Lmao he 's a leader in a culture undergoing indentity crises ? , Lmaooooo
Omg people take this shit too seriously , `` Kjellberg has never been a particularly enlightened individual .
His distracted , screeching patter has always contained a few too many “ bitches ” ; his insistence on addressing his followers as “ bros ” is part and parcel of the unrealistically male-focused view that gaming culture has of its own demographics ( that false-consensus bias again ) .
And as an influencer , that means Kjellberg adds to it by abetting '' , I love the bro army , It 's not a statement of our gaming culture lmao
He seems iffy on if he respects it tbh , But not the point of the article lol
because you ’ re incredulous that anybody could make this much money doing basically nothing — got his just deserts. , 5th paragraph
Not saying u did lol
New pewds is amazing
Omg tht article is written my a dick , Like an actual penis , If u think YouTube is easy and pewds is getting laid for doing nothing than your immediately and idiot to me , YouTube is n't easy it 's extremely taxing , Also pewds is clrly funny to a lot of ppl , I love him lol
Yh thts true
He also made a guy who plays Jesus say Hitler did nothing wrong lmaooo
He apologized in the vid
Dude tht was crazy like those ppl actually did tht
Everyone missed tho joke , The death to all Jews was n't the jome , Joke , The punchline was when they said , Subscribe to keemstar , Lmaoo
Lmao they ai n't poor , Yh I saw the vid when it came out , I cried , So funny
Paying poor people , ?
Lmao he donated a shit ton so no , He lost half his revenue , And sorry but Nazi jokes are funny , It 's tht strange line where fucked up shit being made fun of is funny , But killing Hitler jokes are so much better , Tht vid was hilarious
Did u see his
Lmao no he 's playing off it , Fucking wsj , The dudes is n't a nazi
Same
I tried idubbz , Did n't like him very much , Love h3h3 and pewds
It 's crazy right , Dudes super creepy
Lmaooo
Lol dam , I love when youtube comments are jokes tho , Those are the best
Wut u mean arguing about sjw stuff , Like ur an sjw
How , It 's the best , Watch his newest vid it 's p good
Omg wut
Indeed
Only thing I remember bout 2008 Olympics was Phelps destruction , Like 8 gold medals
Dude it was 2007 , 8* , I was like 11 , I 'll watch later , Vancouver 's was my fav
Idr China 's , So idk
Late shows , h3h3 , and some other stuff
I do it all the time , Just not on tht side of YouTube

13
Lmaooo , Urbon the 13 yr old side of YouTube , Gg
youtube is da shiz nitsz , i love youtube , idk wut ur talking about , youtube has multiple sides , wut side of youtube are u on
It 's such old news were u been
boaty mcboatface , how do u now know about it
Aaaand I 'm done lmao
Yuppp
Mm I guess , https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Wall , huh , history does repeat itself
My mom 's mad short
My dad 's mad tall
... , Sometimes it hurts rina
6 something
Angie likes dudes tht are n't tht much taller than her , But yh my bro also wishes he was shirter , He 's p clumsy
Actually my first crush did , She was a lil shorter than me , But wanted to be shorter so she could be more like a cute Asian girl , She also did n't go for super tall dudes , So ha
Nahhhh , Never , Wut makes u think tbt
U had to did n't u , Ur so funny
Why models so tall
So it 's the beauty show at Javits
small , isk , idk
just like ceres and charon
dwarf planet
yup , thts the def of a planet , a body whose own gravity is enough to make it spherical , and clears its own path , pluto is spherical , but theres a ton of shit in its path and charon ( its moon ) is the same size as it so tf
its be the earth rotates , , but even then its not a perfect oblate spheroid bc of mountains and stuff , no planet is perfect in its geometry , but all planets are more spherical than an asteroid would be , or even some moons
the equator diameter is larger than the pole diameter
wut , its real , the earth just is not perfectly spherical
oblate spheroid
no , no even spheres , obloides
ik , hes like so sophisticated in language , and then theres the word baggie , its like tf , bag , call it a bag
saw it years ago on nasa , was p big news , shows what the early solar system would probs act like
liquid surrounding the solids , https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=k0YuivnCXhM
it was super saturated i believe , no thts wut happened , salt particles joined
nah the salt is visible
just like the first tiny particles our planets were later made out of , aggreagation means that the salt began to combine , just like the tiny ass particles of the early solar system did , onl without gravity can one realize this
ever see a flame in space , my fav is salt water in sapce , it shows aggreagation
aii
watchout , probs gonna be running for pres one day
p sure trump knows more about bio than this dude , this dude made trump look smart
yo grape juice the shiznit , aii , tehy say anything about cookies , are cookies good or bad for cancer , what about radioactive shit , bc if its not dna related then i can eat uranium right
carrot

maybe tht nutritionist has some brilliant ideas
tru , now how to fix my back
its a cat , its funny , cats are funny , yo im mad tired too , and my back is twitching , like my entire back , is most strange
um aii , do I tag her in a meme then

lel good
aight GOOD NIGHT RINA , lmao , so sicne I fucked up last night and probs dont have tht much of a chance with her anymore , can I just send dank memes now , bc she shares dank memes all the time but like I dontwanna tag her to risk friendzone , or is it too out of the blue now

aii good night rina
swear she drinks a shot of redbull before each show
shes an airhead , and shes just a paid one too
dont get me started on tomi pls
when they think theyre funny theyre not either , mhm i agree , aii i gotta go to sleep rina
but he lowkey already had
so yh , but the author was like , kinda dont wanna call conservatives dumb
saitre is a complex form of comedy
someone did a report on it , liberals like satire , conservatives dont
comedy yh
hy old ppl love tht shit , giets them horny i think , tht murica juices flowin
but everyone watches orelly and hannity , and not wallace and sheard , they watch the opnionists as if theyre news , they aint , and they dont give a fuck aout wallace or shepard
but fox news is real news , th eprob is is that thts not the fox news pppl watch when they watch `` fox news '' , orielly and hannity , they arent the news , wallace and shepard are , not even kelly was considered part of th enews line up
yh theyre mainstream
fox news isnt , not
reuters and bloomberg so not , the news agency is secondary to their economics forcasting tools , the news only assists their clients in economic forecasting , this allows them to not have their news thethered to their money as much as other companies , so they can tell the truth more , i like tht
http : //www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-buybacks-cannibalized/ , good read , i love rueters and bloomberg , and I like their corporate style , see the WSJ and NYT make money only from their papers
it realtes to social issues and how stock buybacks lead to income inequality growth
reuters investigative jounralism is da best , love the one about stock bubacks , lit af , bybacks*
hmm havent read any of tht , thts real jounralism , so tht be nice
at least 98 % of the time
but they arent fake news
isk bad writers , in general the tone of the nyt pisses me off , seems arrogant , their articles are too long
i watched the briefing when the teams gave their reports on the higgs boson , and no , but if reuters cant understand it , they dont pretend to , and im fine with tht
lmao i mean it wasnt simple stuff , it was the little details
like take an hour and do research common man , they stick to the demcrats too much
bc i read the headline of the higgs boson , somuch was wrong
reuters science section is bae
nyt isnt lying , but the dramatize and exaggerate only form thierpoint of view , its just annoying to read the nyt to me , their science sections tend to piss me off too , i dont like thier writers
they cater to only their audience
i dont trust wsj ans nyt tht much tbh
but news wires are plai and simple , rueters has an editor section , its p good , but not as good as their wire , which is bland but like , only the facts
yh
this is why i only read rueters and ap tho , bc mud sticks , rather get it from a non biased news wire first
The old saying , yup
brb in 10min
imma read this rn
nah I gtochu , thts what I want to know tho
pls id love to know , ik now very little about cancer and bio , but climate change , thts my shit , come at me with that shit and ill jump down ur throat with at least 5 scientific paperss and a shit ton of data
but tht the thing , the brain is mnemonic , we see soemthing and thats the answer stuck on our brain , even if its wrong , and even if we tell ourselves its wrong
yup
itll give the wrong answer
yh , give a machine the wrong data , no matter how good the machine is
it is , it only measures abliity to see patterns , not really entire cognitive thinking skills , useful but not ht ewhle picutre , a high iq can still be the victim of gaslighting
lol , does it matter
you won
these are founded years ago , way beofre big pharma was a thing , and it undermines the entire papers hypothesis , that DNA has nothign to do with cancer , dna has everything to do with celullar division , SO IT FUCKING DOES
right , thts the thing , celullar division reqiures a dna process
cancer def : is a cell that continously devides , divides
but in general chemotherapy states that killing the cancer cell should slow cancer growth down , but the article aslo states that DNA has nothing to do with cancer , this is problematic , long standing theories of cellular deivison in eukaryotic cells states that it reqiures replication or dna pariing , known as mitosis or meiosis , long standing meanign begore cancer studies
eh , stopping it doesnt even reqiure starvving it of atp , i guss u could do tht , im no biologist tho so
at times reqiuring atp , but is spearheaded by the rna and processes in the dna i believe , idr lemme check
bc atp generates energy , cell division is dependent on it , cell division is a multipstage process
yes
bc it says the def of a cancer cell is dependent on ATP , its not , far more simple , its one that continously divides and multiplies
btw ask him what his def of a cancer cell is , dying to know
https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=BXUhfoUJjuQ , ^^my urrent elvel of rage , current level*
ngjksabgjkdsbg , DNA controlls everything , its the code , of the entire cell , and body , WHAT THE FUCK
shitnts
DNA , you fuckface
btw the def of a cnacer cell in that article is plain wrong , its far more simplisitc
chemotherapy* , sorry
killing cells is called khemotherapy , its kinda a thing , gg , it doesnt work that well , u discovered kheotherapy , be proud
yeah thts how you kill one cancer cell , gg , now how do you kill multiple ones , how about millions , and how , in that process do u not miss one roge cell that then creates a nother carcidgenic chain reaction , what if the dna in other cells is also prone to the same deconstruction
do u know what he just said , he said in fancy terms , if u kill a cell its dangerous to cancer , ATP is the energy supplier of a cell , starve it of ATP it dies fuckface
means hes an idiots , WHAT , idiot
fuckless twit
NO , theyre written by multitude of different sources genius , some funded by big [ harma , some funded by gov , some funded by private researchers , some funded by families of cancer victims
NO , no
NO , NO
oh rina , its too late , hes not using science
these people get me so mad
scientific method fuckface
HE DRANK GRAPE JUICE
GRAPE JUICE , thts not even amusing , ive known eople who have had cancer , one of my cousins friends survived cancer , im close to him
SMALL POX , SWINE FLU , POLIO , gee , idk , bc vaccination industry makes money
you fucking incoherent cockgobber , if cancer is easily curable , THEN WHY DID WE CURE INFLUENZA
isf that were true then why the fuck would we cure any disease
they wouldjust charge a shit ton of money , thts it , basci fukcing econmics , how umb can u be , supply and demand fuckface , shitstick numbuts cancer to all earth , THEY DONT MAKE MONEY BY ITHHOLDING TREAMTEMTN
heres what would happen numbnut , THE COMPANIES WOULD CHARGE MAD MONEY FOR CANCER TREATMENT , fucking retarted motherfucker
he can come at me
so in reality your claim is that cancer is curable bc MSM lies , im a physicist
the hypothesis is that cancer is curable , easily , and that the media lies , part of the hypothesis thus hinges ont e fact that maintsteam media and mainstream science is lying , cancer being easily curable must be secondary to the statement that any data and or statements made form ainstream media are taken to be false
ATP is adenine triphosphate , It 's the source of energy in most of the processes in out body , Out , Our
If cancer was n't caused by DNA damage then uv induced skin cancer would n't be a thing , Also cancer can not be transmitted like a normal disease , You can't kiss someone and give em cancer , Ok let 's take this article from a scientific viewpoint
The entire article is cyclicly defined , And yes it 's fucking obvious a DNA problem can lead to low ATP , Since RNA help to create it in the first place
Unlike journalism scientists created a system to try and stop themselves from becoming assholes , Fucking retarded motherfuxker
It 's called empirical data
Thts how I felt this morning when my aunt commented on my status , Like fuck you I study this shit

They had an eclipse in 2009 , Rlly good one too
Wait when were u China

Yh fuck off China girl , Did n't even wear sunglasses wut r u
Tht alone will be so cook , Cool

No it goes in cycles , Last visible is solar eclipse was 1994 , Us
America has n't had one since I was born , This is the first one
: ( , I 've never seen

YO WHAT R U DOING TO SEE THE SOLAR ECLIPSE THIS YEAR
Not often , Next transit is 2148 or something , Oops 2117 , 2148 is a solar eclipse
You sent a link .

Lol really
Lel u remember transit if venus , Of
But it 's mad hard with planets bc they so far away
Yh absorption and emission lines , How we tell what chemicals are in stellar clouds
When the planet passes in front of the sun the atmospheres compounds will absorb particular wavelengths of light , By sun I mean it 's parent star
Look for mass to size ratios , atmospheric composition , temperature , a steady oribit and procession and a moon to maintain low wobble and ad tides , The main ones are the location , mass and size and atmosphere
Lol can't , Only if it 's atmosphere and location and moons make it a viable candidate to possibly produce organisms
Yh
Light year is a unit of distance , Like the sun is 8 light minutes so 4 light years is far af
Huh
To be fair this
Lmao pls it 's gonna take years to determine if any of these planets meet the current earthlike conditions of habitability
Yh I was like oh fuck , Star might be a sister of our sun , Would make sense if it 's teeming with habitability
And yh ik
Most solar systems have 0 habitable planets and like usually have a Jupiter planet orbiting mad close
I 'm not reading any of these news sources take in science , From intuition tho we did n't find 7 planets
I have n't read the official NASA press release or paper
Which one u moving to
On the bright side NASA found 7 new planets
Idk how the jetstreams and frontal patterns work in AUS , Oklahoma also reached 88 degrees 10 days ago , Strange AF too
Yh it 's a big country , But it 's summertime there , Snow ?
I mean there were mesoscale discussions in the Northeast , in February
No but a 50 degree temps shift and the type of Blizzard , But a line of highly compact and highly convective thunderstorms with lightning tht is characteristic of a hot summertime storm is bizzare
Like why it 's strange ?
kool ill call in a bit
did U call ?
nah im doing other stuff friday
nah I havent played yet y
aii
could say wall in it , like a wall of mirrors , with a broken typography of `` wall : , like how americans need to look in the mirror , idk some shit like tht

Odyssey only takes like 30 min to write , I 'm glad I 'm not the only one who wants to kill someone tonight
Are you fucking kidding me , Thank you Rina , Reagan started this shit show then
I 'm not sure , I think there is a FCC , But idk how much power they have
Nah , CNN and Fox news did n't exist until 1990s , Polarization has been doubled since
Like anything against Trump is fake news , That was n't a thing in Nixons time
Idk who the conservatives would believe though
But FBI is more impartial
Oh yeah facts forgot he was FBI , Thought he was cia
Comey was never fired by trump
Yes and no , FBI is more impartial
If ppl find proof of this , Then maybe
Idk , Watergate was equivalent to Putin hacking the DNC , And since there 's rumor tht Trump bought 19 percent in a Russian oil comp it 's way worse than Watergate
Nah if the president breaks a law things change , I 'm pretty sure Nixon had the house in his favor , And they were gonna impeach his ass
BC the current accusations are n't enough , They 're gonna wait until the right can not deny it , Or at least until they know they 'll get the impeachment in the house
Yes but thts y they gonna wait
Likely yes , The tides already turning
Ikr
Lmaoo
They 're gonna wait for the case to grow and so tht when they try for impeachment they 'll add this to a longer list of fuck ups
I 'm thinking they 're not gonna try impeachment on just this and the emoluments clause
It is , They broke the law , I made a post on it detailing the exact law they broke
Yh and Kellyanne giving a commercial for it , She was like the fuck is tht
My mom is furious about the Ivanka Trump thing
Lmao yh
Aii , I 'll lyk thanks
Yup ik , They probs did tht bc scientists have weird scheduled , So Earth day made sense
I have faith , How to ask tho
Lmao I wish man , Ik some of them think Obama is a Kenyan or a Muslim
Yups , don't even man these people are just funny at this point , Like I don't get how they actually think Soros paid ppl , I wanna debate them on climate change , Idk if everyone here knows it 's real or not , wanna find out
I was like they matched on Saturday , Lmaoo , Same

They work in the island , The ones that work in the city are neutral
Fox news

Queen 's
My dad 's side , And I really don't know , Like I almost died laughing tho
They were talking about the crazy protesters , asking if any of them have jobs , They were like the entire world 's gone crazy and acted like tht did n't give them a signal tht something is up lmaoooo
I 'm with my crazy fam , Imma be venting to u so I don't kill em
Ofc , Aii I got class ttyl
I was mad with tillerson tbh , BC of the environment and foreign policy , Like I 'd rather devos vs tillerson
Tbh I 'm not even shocked , World 's just doing its thing and coming to a slow and painful end
can't believe they confirmed tht bitch
49 % of americans agree with travel ban - reuters , HWO THE FUCK ARE THESE PEOPLE
I still have n't finished the article u sent I gotta finish it , But does n't mean it 's not legit
No I did n't know about this my friend just told me , Yo this is scary
Holy shit they might be appointing bannon to the national security council
What do u think , should we be paranoid about bannon
Trump is n't the next Hitler
Hitler had a lot more help and ran for office prior to becoming a gov official
HOLY SHIT RINA I JUST REALIZED , Bannon is probs planning something
aii , , I believe in the coup now , U don't just fire someone for disagreement in the us
abyss , read later , ; ) , lmao the article just showed up 3 times on me feed , its makign its rounds , nice
no must scroll fb endlessly ans stare into the bayss now
ur crazy , if im still up when u get back ill finish reading tht article and discus it
THTS Y I wanna SLEEP , before trump signs another EO
but im tired , y u want me up so bad
1230
im tired , and yh i have class
oh u saw my comment on the obama vs trump ban post , fucing idiots man , aii gnight rina , dont go to sleep at 4 am pls
what would be ur response
my conservative aunt posted a meme , its sayins `` trying to explain to democrats that trump doesnt want to deport all immigrants only illegals '' , and it shows a man talkign to a wall , i really wanna comment , `` classic for a republican to talk to a wall , yall love walls so much '' , or something wittier , oof
HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISE , WAS A MUSLIM BAN , did u hear rudy guiliani slip up , this is just a legal way of achieving th , tht , OMG RINA
classic tactic
trump makes his ban so outrageous , we protest , he takes away a part of it , to appease us , then the right is like , now stfu , and the actual parts of the muslim ban stay
oh it should , problem is what tht article pointed out
its possible
u sleep , thats an alternative fact , rina wang never sleeps
few thought th w world was really comgin to and end
u , tired ? , lmao thts not a thing , holy shit did u fall asleep
oh ulm aii , yo I wanna visit the german castles , in liek bavaria and shit
when did u live in germany
but in general the stereotypes u know , like mad ocd and always claenaing shit , and italians are overy cocky and way to liberal , too* , my grandfather had a joke , ther germans lost the war bc they were too busy cleaning thier guns
lmao eastern europe is mad hard , so many countries
which is apparently rare , so fuck it idk , but remember how u mentioned u can tell asians apart by thier culture , its also p interesting which sides gave me which cultural traits , like the german side was full of scientists and my grandma loves science a lot , my italian side was full of ppl who were like really good at school and could paint and shit
lmao marino super common last name too , but my great great grandad had two last names
but now how cool would it be if it went back to like the Han dynasty , thts p much how far back I wanna go with mine , to the roman empire
wait so ur directly related to mao , i think uve told me this , lmao nice
yh one day during class my teach had a visitor from like scicily or something , and she turned to me and asked where I was from in italy and when i moved here , i was like huh , how far back does ur fam tree go , how many generations
WHAT , SINCE LIKE LAG
like look up young einstien , look just likehim too , its hilarious bc italians ask me if I immigrated from italy , bc I speak italian , im like ugh no , and then germans think im 100 % german , im like again NO
lmao , but then I also look like a little german boi
imageif it could go back 80000 years
oh yh , dna testign
so the old roman italians are hard to find , but i think i look like a roman italian , i ahve tht small ass mouth and cicular head and the same damn nose as so amny of those busts , germans have bigger jaws
yh same here , like ik my irish side , tbh its boring compared to the italian side , but i really wanna know how far back my italian heritae goes , bc like italy is the hardest of all of europe bc it was so rich thanks to venice , so over time russians , greeks , germans , and french all immigrated there
shit , lucky
wait yh do u know how far back ur heritage goes ?
aka north italy , but then I have a roman nose , but the romans conquered all of europe , the other thing is some person once told my mom tht my great great grandfathers last name signaled royalty , and we were like ugh wut , we poor
yes , but I dont show any signs of being from south italy , and no one in my fam ever has , we look like were from the mountains like near milan or in between milan and rome , but then theres the offchance tht my italian side is really german , bc germans immigrated to italy in 1500 into florence
and my grandfather painted , but tbh I really wish ik exactly where I was from in germany and italy , bc my italian ppl apparently immigrated from bari in the south , but I look nothing like souther italians , theyre tall and skinny , i look like a northern italian
lmao , must have been where she got it from , probs a common scottish name , all ik is my grandmother was a genius , my uncle is a genius and I love talkign to him , and I ofc have this one razy dude who believes in UFOs , but is like p innovative
i dont know too much about , mostly drunks , my moms side was full of scientists and painters , apparently were part scottish or some shit , idk all ik is im somewhat related to alexander fleming , which is ironic bc im allergic to penicilin
nah ma different roots matter , I have german famalies from two different sides , and theyre very different , one german side , my dad
yh my german side faught in ww1
MY GERMAN HERITAGE GOES BACK WAY BEFORE WW2 , ive been here sine 1880 on the german side , my italian great grandfather faught in ww2 on the US side
yh
yo day aft election ppl were giving me looks on the subway , i was like omg no I was with her , like nooo , but yh the tables have turned , germany is the sane voice noe , like wtf man
yh
yh no thts wut he meant ofc
ughh yall okay
he was like , oh but u would survive , I was like , wut , i wasnt paying attention to be fair , so I had no idea what he was taling about , but everyone in the class looked at me , is was like
the horror the nazis did is why I dont find tht shit funny when some asshole calls me a nazi , yh bc I enjoy COOKIGN PEOPLE , a teacher in class said tht once
WHAT
thts where the prob is
but callimg me nazi soldier , like no , tht breaks my hear , heart , but yh making jokes about doing sexual assualt is fucked up no amtter what , some jokes really aint funny , but joking about sexual assault and having another dude not tell u ur insane and fucked up
u guys make white jokes , which is fine im clrly white
yh my friends like joking tht imma nazi , bc im german , and have blue eyes and blonde hair , its not funny at all
i mean fuck theres a mega 9/11 meme , holocaust memes
well tbh humans in general joke about a lot of fucked up shit
most of the time talkign to guys I talk about overanalyzing every little thing a girl does
even if its a joke , I was like bro stfu
ik the diff , nasty shit has been said
ive heard my friends say some nasty shit tbh , but ive shut them up when it goes too far
LOCKER ROOM TALK , yh tht bullshit
jesus
oh thts p rampant thb , tbh
hmm I dont think its rapant , but its not uncommon , I do think its slightly more rare for sexual asault to occur in the opp direction , but like Id dont have any numbers to prove that so eh
i mean i p much think the same , but ik most dont
like randomly grope you ?
what do u mean assaulted , like raped ? , or like someone groped u or soem shit
not* , sorry mean to say accusation does not mean conviction , wait but wtf happened to you , if u dont mind me asking
and the man has the right to ajust trial via the 5th ammendment , so any claim tht men have it bad somehoe forgets they have the right to trail , and that an accusation does mean conviction
women have the right to make an accusation
its proper legal action tbh
ok ok
WAIT WHAT , RINA , U OK , WTF HAPPENED
A kid in my class asked our prof
Then my stat prof who is an immigrant almost broke down crying
He was like not really
I asked my physics prof
Wtf , Today was rough mab , Man
protest and filibuster
omg thts aclssic , but yh if trump appoints the right scotus , he might be able to bypass checks and balances
NO DID HE , DEDDD
i remember when paul ryan siad a muslim ban was no the us way , liik at tht little bitch agreeing with trump , I wanna snap his neck , if he had a backbone
AND WALLA LOK AT THE PROBLEM
that it is found unconsitutional on one of the 3 ammendments mentioned , yh supreme court , theyve struck down executive orders before , all executive orders must undergoe judicial review
not sure , more court orders will be needed , if the judiciary branch finds the executive order unconsitutional then its garbage , so lets hope under judicial review , if the courts bring it up
the states may adhere to it if in agreement , but need not to since such a case is not enumerated in the constitution to be a federal power
10th ammendment is most legit , its the rights enumerated clause , basically those things not enumerated or explcistly said to be a federal power is a power belonging to the staes , the feds have no right to tell new yorkers to bar off mexicans or muslims , or anyone , the fed does not hold that power in peacetime
this is insane , but it goes agsint the first ammendment since it says freedom of religion , though trump has banned from certain countries and not explcitly via a religion ( to avoid immediate legal backlash ) it is clear that each of the barred nations are muslim , so one could argue its unconcstitutional to the first ammendment , the 4th ammendent applies to those detained , or may , which says no search and seizures can simply be perfomed without a proper warrent
visas makes no sense either
Lol sure gim me a sec gotta get on laptop easier to type
Lmao yup , He was like he liked all of trumps executive orders , So I procedded to explain to him how the Muslim ban violates 3 amendments
Yh
So yeah pretty much , Spanish*
Italian and Mexican
Mostly yes
He 's also a college drop out and based on the info supporting his facts gets info from his parents and fix news
Did n't have tht much time and he ended convo , From I have gathered he hated Hillary , And I 'm assuming is a fiscal conservative
Oh I have no idea tbh , And his gf was okay with it , I was like aii
Yh every president does a similar thing tho , Like Obama had a day of reconciliation and recollection or something like tht
And no not from city
No I thought first one was day of patriotic devotion , I obvi don't like repeal of Obama care
I would n't call it rekt unfortunately
So I was hanging with my friend who voted for Trump
Lmao
I thought u endlessly scrolled reddit looking for arguments lol
Lmao , Nice
Omg work a night shift , Nutcase
can't wait till were done with college and have no more all nighters
Lmao aii we 'll talk later , Forgot u had school
If we still have midterm elections lmao
It 's called a recession
Also all these old ppl reminiscing about an old American realize their nostalgia is not bc America was the fucking great back then
U know what 's funny
No but only white people forgot about separation of church and state
Also Republican s approved of Nixon more than Obama , Like wtfff
I saw tht lol
Up until 1990 the average was 40 , Avft tht it dropped to 20 , Roughly
Yeah , The numbers hating the president dropped , The numbers of the party in power liking the president stayed virtually the same
Yh like people of the opposing party hated the president more aft 1994
And notice how the average percentage of people on the opposing party hating the president dropped after 1994 , The same year fox news was created , And only a few years aft CNN came into the picture
http : //www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/07/americas-political-divisions-in-5-charts/ , Notice how the political stances of both parties , even though growing in polarization had the same maxima and minima up until Obama , What changed
Oh wait lemme link u something
They can't handle a different religion or people being gay , But were snowflakes , Fuck they could t even handle a black president
Lmao they keep calling us snowflakes , I 'm like change ur response bully , BC winter is fucking coming , Yes I said tht in a post
I 'm with the side of the scientists , can't believe he 's still silencing us , It 's so wrong , But thts how totalitarianism starts
Same here
Trump is the one gaslighting people
Yh , But they think of us the same way we do , But tbh
Sane Germans tried fighting back the Nazis and followers the same way we do , Like I 'm scared if Trump uses this investigation to change the way voting is done in the us , LMAO imagine the investigation shows tht Clinton won the electoral college , I 'd die
Lol I mean it 's crazy , But like Germans did n't think Hitler was gonna do shit
Lmao imagine future world war
I 'm glad NY and Cali are gonna fight back , We 're not for this bs
Using the police , Like what kf
Do I think we 're slipping into totalitarianism , I can't tell , Like trumps doing everything he said , Remember when he said we needed to round all of the illegals uo , Ip , Up*
So what do u think tho
BC he wants Ukraine , And who says he 'll stop at Ukraine , Maybe he wants the other satellite states back
Russia , Putins gonna want Ukraine
Lol nah it 's real , The furthest we 've been from midnight was 17 min , We 're basically at the start of the cold war , Tbh , It kinda feels like tht too
It 's not empirical and is opinionated , Last time they cited a name directly was Stalin I believe
https : //www.google.com/url ? sa=t & source=web & rct=j & url= % 2Famp % 2Fmobile.reuters.com % 2Farticle % 2Famp % 2FidUSKBN15A2JJ & ved=0ahUKEwi3vNvtyOXRAhUH5YMKHYCXBiQQFggpMAQ & usg=AFQjCNENQwJu9UNdlyBSbBKSdndg2LcBIQ & sig2=-80ddLmRpnwKn8NkFeQ-2A
Omg rina
These are the reasons why I can't tell if the conservatives are right and were over exaggerating
U hear about the doomsday clock
Yeah u hear about the people being turned away from cairo , Idk it might not be , 10th amendment I believe , lemme check , Trump also may get sued in the emoluments clause
Goddamit , I liked him after tht speech , Since when do Cubans like fascism
RUBIO
Yeas I believe so
Wait did t they
They confirmed tillerson , I lost all faith then
But they wo n't bc their electorate does n't want em too
Usually yh
He has all branches of government
Idk I have this nagging feeling tht were blindly slipping into totalitarianistic state and tht war is coming in the next decade
Aii so
aii ill get my scientists friends involved , this is sickening
SCIENTIST MARCH , i have to go if its a scientist march
yup
bro I never thought id ever protest , fuck it now im ready to bare arms agasint this fucker
this is for the office of the press secratary , the only things positive are from editoirals , everything else is spin , but shutting up scientists , WTF IS THIS
at this point in his admin , so the only things that are positive on trump are sean hannity and a chigaco tribune EDITORIAL , NICE , asshat , omg the pipelines thing , from a USA EDITORIAL , jesus christ what world are we living in
wut is this lol , only 45 % approve of his job , and even if int he 50s its way lower than obamas 68 % approval
Not sure tbh
Aii even easier
